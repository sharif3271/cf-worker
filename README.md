# EdgeMaster

EdgeMaster is a minimalistic and versatile microframework for handling routing and request/response interception in cloud-based environments like Cloudflare Workers or serverless functions. It provides a lightweight yet powerful toolset to streamline your edge application development.

- **Fully-Typed**: Enjoy the benefits of TypeScript with complete type definitions.
- **Simplified Routing**: Create concise and expressive routes with ease.
- **Middleware Support**: Implement middleware functions effortlessly, whether built-in or custom.
- **Platform-Agnostic**: Works seamlessly across various cloud-based environments, including Cloudflare Workers and serverless platforms.
- **Route Parameter Parsing**: Easily extract parameters, query strings, and more from your routes.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle errors and define error responses.

## Installation

To get started with EdgeMaster, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install edge-master
```

---

## Getting Started

Here's a simple example of setting up EdgeMaster in a Cloudflare Worker module:

```javascript
import {
  error,      // Creates error responses
  json,       // Creates JSON responses
  Router,     // The microframework router
  withParams, // Middleware: puts parameters directly on the Request
} from 'edge-master';

import { todos } from './external/todos';

// Create a new Router instance
const router = Router();

router
  // Add some middleware upstream on all routes
  .all('*', withParams)

  // GET list of todos
  .get('/todos', () => todos)

  // GET single todo, by ID
  .get(
    '/todos/:id',
    ({ id }) => todos.getById(id) || error(404, 'That todo was not found')
  )

  // 404 for everything else
  .all('*', () => error(404));

// Export as a Cloudflare Worker module
export default {
  fetch: (request, ...args) =>
    router
      .handle(request, ...args)
      .then(json)     // Send as JSON
      .catch(error),  // Handle errors
};
```

## Routing

EdgeMaster simplifies routing in your application. You can create routes and handle HTTP methods with ease.

```javascript
const router = Router();

router
  .get('/path', (request) => /* Handle GET request */)
  .post('/path', (request) => /* Handle POST request */)
  .put('/path', (request) => /* Handle PUT request */)
  .delete('/path', (request) => /* Handle DELETE request */)
  .all('/path', (request) => /* Handle any method for /path */);
```

### Route Parameters

EdgeMaster allows you to define route parameters and access them in your route handlers.

```javascript
router.get('/users/:id', ({ id }) => /* Access the "id" parameter */);
```

### Wildcards and Optional Segments

You can use wildcards and optional segments to create flexible route patterns.

```javascript
router.get('/files/*', (request) => /* Match any path after /files/ */);

router.get('/page(/:section)', ({ section }) => /* Optional "section" parameter */);
```

---

## Interceptors

EdgeMaster provides a convenient way to intercept incoming requests and outgoing responses using interceptors. Interceptors can be used for tasks such as authentication, logging, and response modification.

### Request Interceptors

Request interceptors are executed before your route handlers, allowing you to modify the incoming request.

```javascript
const authenticationInterceptor = {
  type: InterceptorType.Request,
  async intercept(context) {
    // Check authentication and modify the request if needed
    const { req } = context.reqCtx;
    // ...
    return req;
  },
};

router.addInterceptor(authenticationInterceptor);
```

### Response Interceptors

Response interceptors are executed after your route handlers, enabling you to modify the response before it's sent back to the client.

```javascript
const loggingInterceptor = {
  type: InterceptorType.Response,
  async intercept(context) {
    // Log the response or make changes before sending it
    const { res } = context;
    // ...
    return res;
  },
};

router.addInterceptor(loggingInterceptor);
```
